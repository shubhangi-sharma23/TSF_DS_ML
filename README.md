#Task 02 - Simple Linear Regression

In this regression task, we will predict the 'percentage of marks' that a student is expected to score based upon the 'number of hours they studied'.
This is a simple linear regression task, involving just two variables.

#Task 03 - Unsupervised Machine Learning

From the given "Iris" dataset, we will predict the 'Optimum Number of clusters' using K-Means Clustering and represent it visually.
